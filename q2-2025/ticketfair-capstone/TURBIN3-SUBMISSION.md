## 🎯 Project Overview: TicketFair Platform

### **Problem Statement**
The global ticketing industry ($85B+ market) suffers from:
- **Scalping dominance** - Bots buying tickets instantly for resale at 300-1000% markup
- **Price manipulation** - Lack of fair price discovery mechanisms
- **Centralized control** - Single points of failure and censorship
- **Fraud vulnerability** - Counterfeit tickets and payment scams

### **Solution: Dutch Auction Ticketing**
TicketFair eliminates scalping through **Dutch auctions** that provide fair price discovery:
- **Price starts high** and declines linearly over time
- **Early bidders pay market rate**, not speculation premium
- **Automatic refunds** for overpaid amounts
- **Compressed NFTs** for cost-effective, scalable tickets
- **Complete transparency** - all operations on-chain and verifiable

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Core Technology Stack**
- **Solana Blockchain** - High-performance, low-cost transactions
- **Anchor Framework** - Rust-based Solana program development
- **Compressed NFTs (Bubblegum v2)** - Scalable ticket representation
- **TypeScript Client** - Generated from IDL using Codama
- **Solana-Kite** - Enhanced client utilities

### **Smart Contract Components**

#### **Account Structures**
```rust
// Event - Represents ticketed event with Dutch auction
pub struct Event {
    pub organizer: Pubkey,
    pub ticket_supply: u32,
    pub start_price: u64,     // Dutch auction start price
    pub end_price: u64,       // Dutch auction end price
    pub auction_start_time: i64,
    pub auction_end_time: i64,
    pub status: EventStatus,  // Created, Active, Finalized
    // ... additional fields for cNFT integration
}

// Bid - Tracks auction bids with escrow
pub struct Bid {
    pub bidder: Pubkey,
    pub event: Pubkey,
    pub amount: u64,          // Escrowed amount
    pub status: BidStatus,    // Pending, Awarded, Refunded
}
```

#### **Program Instructions**
1. **Event Management**
   - `create_event` - Initialize event with Dutch auction parameters
   - `activate_event` - Start auction and enable bidding
   - `finalize_auction` - Set closing price and enable awards/refunds

2. **Bidding System**
   - `place_bid` - Submit bid at current Dutch auction price
   - `award_ticket` - Transfer cNFT ticket to winning bidder
   - `refund_bid` - Return funds for unsuccessful bids

3. **User Management**
   - `create_user` - Initialize user profile for activity tracking

### **Key Technical Innovations**

#### **Dutch Auction Price Calculation**
```rust
pub fn calculate_current_price(
    start_price: u64,
    end_price: u64,
    start_time: i64,
    end_time: i64,
    current_time: i64,
) -> u64 {
    if current_time <= start_time {
        start_price
    } else if current_time >= end_time {
        end_price
    } else {
        let elapsed = (current_time - start_time) as u64;
        let duration = (end_time - start_time) as u64;
        let price_drop = start_price - end_price;
        start_price - (price_drop * elapsed / duration)
    }
}
```

#### **Escrow Pattern for Bid Security**
- Bid funds held in Program Derived Address (PDA)
- Automatic refund processing through smart contracts
- Partial refunds for winners (excess above closing price)
- Full refunds for losing bidders
